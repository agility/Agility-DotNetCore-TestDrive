# Agility Test Drive for .NET Core

This is a helper repo to help you get started with the Agility Test Drive.

If you wish to use this with your Agility Test Drive, clone the Repo and update the appsettings.json with your Website Name and Security Key.

Then, in the Agility Content Manager, change the Development Framework to .Net Core (Settings, Development Framework).
After that, you'll need to update your module definitions to render via a ViewComponent instead of a Controller Actions.

If you run into any problems with this process please contact us at support@agilitycms.com
