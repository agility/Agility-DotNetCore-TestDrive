
<p>Take the pain away from forms! Use the built-in Form module to create a Form based off of your properties (text, images, files, etc.) and submit to User Generate Content (UGC) with no development required.</p>

<p>Want something custom? Use the UGC API to save, search, or delete your content as you like. UGC API is available in JavaScript and C#</p>
