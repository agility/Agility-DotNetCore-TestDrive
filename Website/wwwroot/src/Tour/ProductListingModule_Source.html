
<p>Here's an example of a more complex Module that lists all products in a Content List and also give us the options of filtering by a category. Agility provides you with auto-generated strongly typed C# API classes based on your content and module definitions. Build your schema, download your classes, get coding!</p>


<pre class="csharp">
int skip = (page - 1) * pageSize;
int take = pageSize;

string rowFilter = string.Format(&quot;ProductCategoryID = {0}&quot;, categoryID);

var products = new AgilityContentRepository&lt;Product&gt;(&quot;Products&quot;).Items(rowFilter, &quot;Title ASC&quot;, take, skip);
</pre>
